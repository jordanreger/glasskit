# GDK Documentation Archive

Welcome to the *un*official official GDK documentation archive. This archive may be full of broken links, content errors, etc., but it's simply here to be a backup just in case Google ever gets rid of the [official GDK documentation](https://developers.google.com/glass). If you do happen to find a broken link, content error, or something else, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/GlassKit/website/issues)!
